Stress analysis is a crucial aspect of engineering and material science that involves the study of how forces and loads affect the mechanical behavior of materials and structures. 
The primary objective of stress analysis is to ensure that a structure or component can safely withstand the applied forces without failure or deformation beyond acceptable limits.
